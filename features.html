				<p>  Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. 

As an independent bookstore, we strive to offerthe same variety and richness of experience as the books on our shelves.And because the only people we’re beholden to are ourcustomers and ourselves, we can focus on what really matters of promoting diverse perspectives, upholding 
the free exchange of ideas, championing the enduring power of books, and bolstering the great community of readers and authors we’re lucky to be a part of.

Online Bookshop Provide first access to different books, articles , magazines and journals.They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.

Although the buying and selling of books for profit has always been an aim of booksellers, bookstore archives reveal the myriad other activities taking place amid the commerce.Blurring the lines among the different sorts of intimacy and creativity realized in rooms full of books
